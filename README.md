### React Hooks - Setup to write first React Hook

#### Repo to go with [article](https://medium.com/@cbrannen/getting-your-hooks-into-react-a7b9b8694959)

This project was originally written when React Hooks were in Alpha since version 16.8 they've been part of the standard library as well as linting rules being updated to include the rules that assist with their setup.

As a result I've updated the dependencies and to reflect this to view the project at this point please view: https://github.com/cbrannen9a/react-hooks-example/tree/v1.0

I have subsequently converted the project to use Typescript.

#### Setup

To start this project just clone the repo, install the dependencies and then

```
yarn start
```

The Example file contains an example hook to start with.
